# mywebsite

My personal website, https://johnidehai.com, is my first project to go live online.

I decided to step away from my familiar styling ground of Bootstrap5 library this time, and therefore relied on CSS as provided by "Ethereal by HTML5 UP".
It is a bold attempt at achieving horizontal sliding. I incorporated some PHP commands to connect to MySQLi database and to collect data on both site and page views.

I pushed this project to my public repository for reviews and comments and to demonstrate my understanding of CSS and PHP MySQLi.

Thank you.
